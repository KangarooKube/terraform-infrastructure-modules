# Azure Log Analytics

Deploys an [Azure Log Analytics Workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/log_analytics_workspace).

## Quick start

Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform configurations. 

See [examples/aks-rbac-yes](../../../examples/aks-rbac-yes) that deploys an AKS Cluster with Log Analytics for K8s Audit Logging.
